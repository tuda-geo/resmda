``dageo`` - Data Assimilation in Geosciences
============================================

Data Assimilation in Geosciences is, for now, a simple 2D reservoir simulator
and a straight-forward implementation of the basic *Ensemble smoother with
multiple data assimilation* (ESMDA) algorithm as presented by Emerick and
Reynolds, 2013. However, more DA methods and examples might be added in the
future.
